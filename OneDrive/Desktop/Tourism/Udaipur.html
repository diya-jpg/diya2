        <p>A majestic architectural marvel towering over the lake on a hill surrounded by crenelated walls, it is a conglomeration of courtyards, pavilions, terraces, corridors, rooms and hanging gardens. The main entrance is through the triple arched gate, the "Tripolia" with eight marble porticos, The Maharanas were weighed under the gate in gold, the equivalent amount of which was distributed among the populace. The surajgokhada, the balcony of the sun, is where the SuryanshiMaharanas of Mewar presented themselves to the people in the time of trouble to restore their confidence. The 'MorChowk' known for its exquisite peacock mosaics in glass and the 'ChiniChitrashala' noted for its blue and white ceramics are other attractions in the palace. A high tech sound and light show is conducted every evening at the magnificent ManakChowk which brings alive the rich history of Mewar.</p>

        <p>Now a hotel but was originally called Jagniwas and served as a summer palace. Built between 1743 and 1746 on the island near Jagmandir in Lake Pichola, the palace, which faces east, is a wondrous sight to behold. The walls made of black and white marbles are adorned with semi-precious stones and ornamented niches. Gardens, fountains, pillared terraces, and columns line its courtyards.</p>

    <p>Jagmandir is a palace built on an island on the Lake Pichola. Also called the ‘Lake Garden Palace’, the construction for this began in 1620 and was completed around 1652. The royal family used the palace as its summer resort and for hosting parties. Interestingly, Prince Khurram - later Emperor Shah Jahan - was given shelter here when he rebelled against his father Emperor Jahangir. The Palace had such an impact on Emperor Shah Jahan that it went on to become the inspiration for one of the most magnificent Wonders of the World, The Taj Mahal.</p>

   <p>Situated just outside Udaipur, this 19th-century palace is built on top of Bansdara hills. Used as a monsoon palace and hunting lodge, its builder, Maharana Sajjan Singh, originally planned to make it an astronomical center.
